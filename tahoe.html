<h1>I have a place in South Lake Tahoe so I had a lot of plans in Tahoe this summer</h1>
  <br>
One of my main plans was to invite all of my friends up to the house for a week. We could go to the beach, wakeboard on my boat, clif jump and a lot more.
<br>
<br>
Thaoe is also just a nice place to live during the summer. I have friends up their and it is alwas=ys nice to see them.<br>
